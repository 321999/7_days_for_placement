 what  is squelize-cli 

 ```
 The command `npm i sequelize-cli` is used to install the Sequelize Command Line Interface (CLI) tool as a Node.js package using the npm (Node Package Manager). Let's break down what this means:

1. **npm:** npm stands for "Node Package Manager." It's a command-line tool that comes bundled with Node.js and allows you to manage and install packages (libraries) written in JavaScript. These packages can be used to extend the functionality of your Node.js applications.

2. **i:** The `i` in `npm i` is a shorthand for the `install` command. It's used to install packages from the npm registry.

3. **sequelize-cli:** Sequelize is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js that simplifies working with relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more. The Sequelize Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that assists in creating database migrations, models, and seeders, making it easier to manage and evolve your database schema.

When you run `npm i sequelize-cli`, you're instructing npm to download and install the Sequelize CLI package. This allows you to use command-line commands provided by Sequelize CLI to generate and manage your database-related files, such as migrations, models, and seeders.

After the installation is complete, you'll be able to use commands like `sequelize init`, `sequelize model:create`, `sequelize migration:create`, and others to set up your database structure and manage migrations and data seeders easily.

Remember that the Sequelize CLI is typically used in conjunction with the Sequelize library itself, which provides the ORM functionality. You might need to install both Sequelize (`npm i sequelize`) and Sequelize CLI to create a comprehensive database management solution for your Node.js application.
