    <h1>namaste everyone</h1>
    <p>from know onwords we will gong to start with the seven days of ur preparation</p>
    <p>firt we have to create our repo where we have to initiate the git so that git can trace that file 
    <span>there are two types of file is present in the directory file one is traced file and another one is untraced file

        traced file are those file which are added to stagging area  to commit and untraced file are those file which are not added in your directory or it resides in our directory  

    </span>

<b>stagging area</b><span>stagging area are those area which can traceble are git can trace that file to put the untraced file into traceblefile we use <b>git add</b> this command to add into the stagging area  </span></p>
<h1>"git rm --cached <file>..."</h1>
    <span>to remove from  stagging area</span>
    <p>git commit -a -m "Updated index.html with a new line"</p>
    wecan use this to commit directly without write the command for stagging 

    <u>
        <li>to see the history of commit   we use git log </li>
        <li>commit with --date instead  of -m</li>
        <li>git commit --date="2023-08-15 14:30:00" -m "Commit message"</li>
