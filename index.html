    <h5>what is the database</h5>
    <p>db is the place where we store the data in systmatic and in organised manner</p>

    <h5>what is dbms</h5>
    <p>dbms stands for data base management system which is used to manage and maintain the data </p>
    <p>in this only when the data is store relationally then we call it as relational database</p>

    <h1>RDBMS</h1>
    <LI>it stands for relational database management system</LI>
    <li>in rdbms data is store in the form of relation</li>
    <li>when dbms software follow the relational model then it is  called rdbms</li>
    <li>also when dbms follows the ef code rule then it iscalled the rdbms

<h5>what is datatype</h5>
<p>it is used to give rule to the column</p>
<ul>
    <q>&lt</q>
    <code>&lt and &gt </code>
    <B>NOTE:</B><q>&lt</q> is used to print &lt; and &gt is used to print &gt;
    <label>there are 5 types  of dataype in   <abbr title="structure query language is used to communicate with the data in RDBMS">SQL</abbr> </label>
            <li>char</li>
                <description>char datatype is used to store alltypes of data and whenever we require the fixed lenth memory allocatoin than we are going yto use it 
                    it is also called fixed length memory allcation 
                   <li>it can holds the value upto 200 of memory</li>
                   <Li>we can say that there is one disadvantage that unused memory is wastage</Li>
<li>all the data in char data should be in single quote </li>
                </description>
            <li>varchar
                <Li>to overcome the limitatin of char we have var which is 
                    also called variable lenght memory allocation 
                </Li>
            </li>
            
            <li>largeobject
        <li>char large object of size 4gb
            <ol>
                <li>binary large object of size 4gb used tostore the multimedia file</li>
                <Li>char large object</Li>

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Date
            <description>this is nto the datatype we can say it is the format which is dd mm yy but if we want to talk about the futer or past we should use dd mm yyyy</description>
        </li>
        <li>Number</li>
        this datatype is used to validate teh column that it is only allow to enter the numeric value only 
        inside t enumber we have different cases
        one is when precision is greatere that no of decimal value 
        <!-- </Nav> -->
        number(4,8)
        from 4 interger value 8 decimal value is therer
        case 2
        when preciion is greater tha decimal value 
        number(4,2)
from 4 highes digit number only 2 digit are in decimal value
        number()
        case3:when we havce the precision as 0 that i sthe wrong input 

        <!-- <li>binary large object of size 4gb used tostore the multimedia file</li> -->
            </li>

</ul>

<h4>
    constraint 
<p>the condition given  to columnm is called constraint 
    <ul><label>there are five types of constraint 
        <li>unique</li>
        <p>unique is the constraint givne to column before entering data into the column so that duplicate vlaue is not allowed</p>
        <li>not  null</li>
        <b>note:null is the keyword used to specity empty or nothing</b>
        <p>not null is the constraint added to the column which means not any cell should ve empty  it should have some value in it 
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <li>check</li>
        <p>check means adding an extra condtion to the column example sal column should not contain negative value</p>
        <li>primary key</li>
        <p>primary key is the key which uniquely represtn the table
    <li>it  should  be  unique and not null</li>
<Li>primary key is not mandatory but design wise it is preferable </Li> </p>
        <li>foreign key</li>
        <p>to eastablish the relation between two table foreign key is used 
            <Li>foreighn key is the key which is the primary key in its original column and reside in the another table </Li>
            <Li>foreign key can be unieque and can be not null </Li>
            <Li>foreign key actually belongs to parent table but it stays in child table to eastablish the connection</Li>
            hence  it is called the referentiall integrity constraint
            <li>foreign is not mandatory </li>
            
        </p>
        
    </label></ul>

    <h3> <abbr title="structure query language is used to communicate with thedata in  the rdbms">sql</abbr></h3>
        there are 5 types of SQL
<LI>DDL</LI>
<LI>DML</LI>
<LI>TCL</LI>
<li>DCL</li>
THIS is used for cretion of the table  

<li>DQL</li>
this is used for managing and retrieval of the data from the table 
        <!-- <li><abbr title="data query language">DQL</abbr></li> -->
        <li> <abbr title="transaction control language">TCL</abbr> TQL</li>

        <lI><ABBR title="data definition language">DDL</ABBR></lI>

        <li><abbr title="data query language">DQL</abbr></li>

<h5>there are 5 componsent of <b>DQL</b></h5>
 <li>select is used to retrieve the data from  the table which is there in the dataase
    <description></description>
 </li>
 <li>projection is used the retrieve the data from the table usign column name</li>
 <li>selection is used to retrieve the data from the table using row and column name </li>
   <li>joins is used to retrieve the data from multiple table</li> </ol>


combination of selct clause and from clause is called projection
<p>whenever we open the sql as administrator
    <Li>first command  to enter is <b>SET PAGES 300 LINES 300</b> AND SECOND ONE IS <B>CL SCR</B> AND TO know how many tables or how many tables are present in the current database we use select * from tab</Li> </p>
</p>
</h4>

<h3 style="background-color: aqua;">keyword wise concept</h3>
<ul>
    <Li>expression:-any operation which give output iscalled expression 
        in this we have two types one is direct(sal*12) and another one undirect(sal +comm)
    <Li>alia is used to give alternate name to the column  name  </Li>
    <li>it is the temporary name given to the column only on the resultant table </li>
    <Li>it will not modify the original name of the column name</Li>
    <b>any operation which performwith null gives the output as null</b>
    col_name as helo/"hello wordl"/hello_world 
    <!-- <li></li> -->
    <li><b>Alias</b>  </li>
</ul>

for rdbms we have ef code rule first is te data to be entered in a cell  should be single and atomic
to validate the table datatypes and constraint are added to the column 
we can store the data in mujltiple table using joins
datatype are mandatory but constraints are optional

    <h1>Normalisation</h1>
    normalisation is the technique to store and organise the data in multiple relatinal tables 
    normalisation is a technique to organise the data into multiple related table 
    <h45>what is redundancy</h45>
    <p>repeatatin of the data  in multile place same column redundancy </p>
    <aside>redundancy can increase the size of the database issures with deletein updataion and retrieving 
    </aside>
    <table>
        <tr >
            <td>id</td>
            <td>name</td>
            <td>branch</td>
            <td>hod</td>
            
        </tr>
        <tr >
            <td>1</td>
            <td>k</td>
            <td>cse</td>
            <td>kishore</td>
            
        </tr>
        <tr >
            <td>2</td>
            <td>i</td>
            <td>cse</td>n
            <td>kishore</td>
            
        </tr>

    </table>
    <p>o in the above table we can see that hod and branch column value are repeating which areise the problem of redundancy and which results the increse the size of the database
        .obviously unneccessary data repeatation increase the size of the database and leads more issures as well 
        <ol>
            <li>insetion anomaly</li>
            <describe>this problem occur when u cant add a piece of data wihout addign unrelated data,this results unneccessary data store in the database</describe>
            <describe>normalisation in this can help by making the divide and rule which separating the id name branch with (branch and hod) know if u want add new record u dont have to repeat the data u just have to enter the 3 value ie name id and branch so this will reduce the redundancy</describe>
            similarly this will arise the problem of
            <li>deletion anomaly </li>
            <describe>when we want to delete a piece of data unintentionally important data is also deleted which is relevant</describe>
            <describe>after normalisation only the relevant data is deleted while dividng the table only the data is deleted which we want to delete intentionally </del> </describe>
            <li>updation anomaly</li>
            <description>an update anomally happens when we update the data in one place doesnot update it in all relevant place</description>
            Update Anomaly: An update anomaly happens when updating data in one place doesn't update it in all relevant places, leading to inconsistencies. For instance, if a customer changes their address, it should be updated in one location, but if the data is stored redundantly, updates might be missed in some instances.
            <description>after applyign the normalisation only point of the data is updated not if we want to update the value due to less amount of data consistency can achieve</description>
     this is way how normalisation can help us to organise the data in multiple related table to reduce the redundancy 
    
     <ul>1NF
        <Li>first normalisation form atleat our schema should follow the 1nf (in this we have four rule)
            <Li>data entered in a shellshould be atomic</Li>
            <li>data entered in a shell be of same data type</li>
            <Li>data entered in a shell can be of any order </Li>
            <li>colunn name of the table should not repeat to avoid the confusion </li>
            <b>note:if any shell doesnot  have atomic vlaue of it has two value in the same cell than than seaparate it and make new record of it mean break the value into twol different atomic or break the value into atomic value </b>
        </Li>
    <li>2nf is the second normal form 
        for sheman to be in 2nf it should be first 1nf 
        1 nf normalisatoin function 
        ie in  a cell only single or atomic shluldbe therer
        name of the column should not repeat in a table 
        the data entered in a colulmn should be of same datatype 
        we can store the data in a column in any order

        primary key is thekey wehich is used to represent the table some time if we hace n to n connection then make sure that each column should be dependent to this 
        there should not be patial dependencies if it is remove it and make new 
    <table border="1">
        <th style="text-align: center; letter-spacing: 2;" colspan="5">score table</th>
        <tr style="background-color: aqua;">
            <td>score id</td>

            <td>subject_id
            <td>marks</td>
            <td>teacher</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>82</td>
            <td>ja</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>

            <td>teacher</td>
        </tr>
    
    </table>
    <description>by watching the table only we can say that score_id is the primary key ,but in thsi we can see that the combination of student id and the subject id can be the primary key as well </description>
    but whle desighning the schema of student so what u think about student ha sid,sscoreid,sid,techer(who is responsible to teach that subject)
